Completed a job simulation by PWC Switzerland where I strengthened my Power BI skills to better understand clients and their data visualization needs. The purpose of this dashboard was to provide clear and insightful visualizations to enhance customer retention strategies in the telecom industry. The focus was to help the management team understand customer demographics, identify at-risk customers, and improve strategies for retaining customers. The dashboard has a user-friendly layout allowing the viewer to quickly access and comprehend data. Interactive charts and graphs give dynamic insights, allowing for speedy decision-making.
